### Tailwind CSS
1. Before jumping into Tailwind CSS, let's understand what Atomic CSS is. "Atomic CSS is the approach to CSS architecture that favours small, single-purpose classes with names based on visual function." <br>
It's kinda like making classes that are supposed to achieve a single purpose. e.g. -> let's make a bg-blue class with the following CSS:
    ```css
    .bg-blue {
        background-color: rgb(81, 191, 255);
    }
    ```
    Now if we add this class to a h1 tag, it will get a background of blue.
    ```css
    <div><h1 class="bg-blue">Hello world!</h1></div>
    ```
- Now imagine writing such useful single-purpose CSS rules and keeping them all in a global CSS file. I know it's a one-time investment but think of this â€“ you can now use these single-purpose helper classes from anywhere you want.
- You just need your HTML file to consume that global CSS file, and that's it. You can now also use combinations of these helper classes in a single HTML tag.
- And that's where Tailwind CSS comes in. The concept of Atomic CSS is not new but Tailwind CSS takes it to another level.

2. Tailwind CSS, as per their own website is a "utility-first CSS framework" which provides several of these opinionated, single-purpose utility classes that you can use directly inside your markup to design an element. <br>
<b>Tailwind is a CSS framework that provides us with single-purpose utility classes which are opinionated for the most part, and which help us design our web pages from right inside our markup or .js/.jsx/.ts/.tsx files.</b> <br>
Some of the utility classes:
    - flex: Used to apply Flexbox to a div
    - items-center: to apply the CSS property align-items: center; to a div

- we do not have to write these utility classes ourselves and keep them in any global CSS file. We directly get them from Tailwind.
- You can get a list of all the utility classes Tailwind has to offer from the documentation page.
- Also if you are working in VS Code, you can install an extension called Tailwind CSS IntelliSense and it will give you auto-suggestions as you keep typing the utility classes.

3. Using the same variant of a particular utility class at different areas in the UI also ensures uniformity across the whole application and results in a better UX. 
- But in case you need some really customised value for any particular style, you can get that by adding a customized theme in the tailwind.config.js:
    ```css
    module.exports = {
        theme: {
            extend: {
                boxShadow: {
                    '3xl': '0 35px 60px -15px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3)',
                }
            }
        },
        screens: {
            //adding breakpoint for (min-width: 300px)
            'xsm': '300px',
            // => @media (min-width: 300px) { ... }
        },
    }
    ```
- you can also use an arbitrary value inside square brackets [] like the following:
    ```css
    <div class="shadow-[0_35px_60px_-15px_rgba(0,0,0,0.3)]">
    // Rest of your code goes here
    </div>
    ```

### Setup Tailwind CSS
- Go to official documentation or some blogs to setup tailwind css according to framework or library.

### Important styles
- To give padding to every devices (responsive design) use: 
    ```cs
    <div className='w-full px-[440px] sm:px-[100px] md:px-[140px] lg:px-[300px] xl:px-[420px] 2xl:px-[560px]'>
    ```
